All code for running the experiments for the improvements that we tried is given in the `improvements_sts/experiments` folder. This folder contains batch scripts for running all configurations of the corresponding experiment. These script do not work right away for other users since they contain the username and custom paths. These must be changed accordingly. The experiments are logged in `improvements_sts/logs`. `datasets` contains the modified dataset class that contains the custom data augmentations.
